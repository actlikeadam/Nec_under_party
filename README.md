# Nec_under_party

Technical test
Date: September 2018

Demo: https://necunderparty.gattaca.site/

Task:
Here at the NEC, we host an Annual Christmas party for our Exhibition Organisers â€“ as you can imagine, this requires a massive amount of logistical planning. 
For this reason, we send out an invite to potential attendees beforehand, driving them to a landing page in order to capture all of the necessary information.
The theme last year was a New York Christmas.
 
Your task is to style and structure the landing page by presenting the questions in a user-friendly, on-brand, attractive data capture form.

Notes:
- The form doesn't need to be submitted anywhere. A thank you message when they click "finish" will be enough.
- Notice two different end points on the form: 
                - The user won't be attending the event. (Select NO on "Are you able to attend our Christmas party")
                - The user fills in all the required information to attend the event.
- There are some fields that may not be required depending on the user selections. For example, the dietary requirements if they don't have any.
